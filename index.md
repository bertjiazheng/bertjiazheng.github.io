## About Me

I am currently an engineer and researcher at [Manycore Tech Inc.](https://www.manycoretech.com), where I work with [Dr.&nbsp;Zihan Zhou](https://zihan-z.github.io). My research interests lie in spatial intelligence, particularly in spatial understanding and spatial generation.

I obtained my master's degree from [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn) (A newly established university in 2013) and [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.edu.cn). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn). During my time at ShanghaiTech, I had the privilege of working with [Dr.&nbsp;Shenghua Gao](https://cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/gaosh) and [Dr.&nbsp;Yi Ma](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/).
