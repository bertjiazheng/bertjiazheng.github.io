## About Me

I am a Research Engineer at [Manycore Tech Inc.](https://www.manycoretech.com), where I work closely with [Dr.&nbsp;Zihan Zhou](https://zihan-z.github.io). My research interests focus on spatial intelligence, encompassing both spatial understanding and spatial generation in applications in AI systems.

I obtained my Master's degree from [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn) (A newly established university in 2013) and [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.edu.cn). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn). During my graduate studies at ShanghaiTech, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Dr.&nbsp;Shenghua Gao](https://cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/gaosh) and [Dr.&nbsp;Yi Ma](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/).

I am actively looking for self-motivated interns who are passionate about advancing the frontiers of spatial intelligence. If you're interested in working on innovative AI research and share this vision, feel free to reach out via email.
